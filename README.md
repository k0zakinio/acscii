## ASCII Image Editor

A simple ASCII image editor, a tech test which I have used to try and get a better understanding of Java.  

You will notice there is no testing, however I may revisit and add some testing when I figure out how best to test in Java.

#### How it works

Simply put, the editor allows you to:  

* Create a canvas: C [width] [height]  
* Draw a point: P [x1] [y2]  
* Draw a line: L [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2]  
* Draw a square/rectange: S [x1] [y1] [x2] [y2]  (1 being upper left and 2 being low right corners)  
* Bucket fill: B [x1] [y1] [filler]  
* Clear canvas: E
* Undo last action: U
* Quit: Q
